# Supervised Learning Flow  

This project implements a **Supervised Learning Flow** using training and testing datasets. The datasets are provided in CSV format, and the model is trained on `wine_train.csv` and evaluated on `wine_test.csv`.  

## ðŸ“Œ Files  

- **`wine_train.csv`** â€“ The training dataset used to build the model.  
- **`wine_test.csv`** â€“ The testing dataset used to evaluate model performance.  

## ðŸš€ Features  

âœ” **Supervised Learning Model** â€“ Implements a machine learning model trained on wine classification data.  
âœ” **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handles missing values, normalizes features, and prepares data for training.  
âœ” **Model Training & Evaluation** â€“ Trains a classification model and evaluates it on test data.  
âœ” **Performance Metrics** â€“ Provides accuracy, confusion matrix, and other evaluation metrics.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  

- **Python**  
- **NumPy & Pandas** (Data Manipulation)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
